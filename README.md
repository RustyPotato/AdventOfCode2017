# AdventOfCode2017

### SPOILERS
If you are currently working on your own challenges, I suggest against copying
my code. It's considered cheating, and ... it's mostly unfair for people on 
your local leaderboards. 

### This Project
This is just a simple little project that I'm doing. I in no way advocate for 
people cheating with my code. I just wanted to put it up here for public 'help'
and my own personal record keeping. Feel free to do as you wish with it, just
be sure to follow the license. 

### Improvements
I really need to comment this code eventually. Right now it's a mess. I'll 
see if I can either do it while competing or after the competition.
